      <!-- Some overall information about me -->
      <section class="about">
        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
          I'm currently the head of development at <a href="http://onetouchhcm.com/" class="dark-purple">OneTouch HCM</a>, where I have been implementing full stack code for over 12 years. 
          I started off as an entry level Software Engineer and quickly became one of the GOTO Engineer's in the company for technical related inqueries.  I served as the backup whenever 
          the VP of Development  was sick or away.  I learned to lead from those who have lead me, and eventually ended up in a position where I am now the leader.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I do enjoy the challenges that my new role pose, I enjoy writing code so much more.  In fact, I enjoy it so much that I take time to write code to improve our software
          that goes above and beyond the scope of my current position. I love to solve problems and build new software and features.  The shift in role requirements has taken away from my
          true talent..
        </p>
        <p>
          I am seeking an opportunity to get back to doing what I love .. Writing Code! I am hoping to find a job that will allow me to stick to a 40-50 hour work week, with good pay and 
          the flexibility to work remotely.  If you or your company can offer that, please contact me so that we can discuss the opportunity further.  I am still always learning, and not stuck in my ways.
          I will be able to adhere to whatever culture the company has, and provide solid code for whatever your needs are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the website you are browsing right now was homegrown and created by hand (please do right click and the view source code).  No building off of some pre-existing template or module, 
          tho I am not opposed to using them. It is just much more fun to build it myself, and create it exactly as I want it.  
          Sometimes we have to work in the box, but oftentimes we are confronted with technical solutions which require us to think outside the box.. Maybe even redifine the box alltogether!
